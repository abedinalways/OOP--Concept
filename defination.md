#OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It’s a programming paradigm based on the concept of ‘objects’, which represent real-world entities. Each object contains data (as properties) and behavior (as methods).
The core principles of OOP are:

Encapsulation: Wrapping data and functions together to protect internal state.

Inheritance: Reusing existing code by creating child classes from a parent class.

Polymorphism: Having methods with the same name behave differently depending on the context.

Abstraction: Hiding complex logic and showing only essential features to the user.
